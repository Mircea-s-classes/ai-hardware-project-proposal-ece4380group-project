# AI Hardware Project Proposal Template

## 1. Project Title
ECE4380Group project

Miles Mayhew, Zackary Dickens

Gesture Recognition System

## 2. Platform Selection
We selected the Raspberry Pi AI Kit since it has a good balance of performance, flexibility, and usability. This platform can perform low-latency inference on visual data and the Raspberry Pi supports a wide range of cameras which can be used to collect data.

**Undergraduates:** Edge-AI, TinyML, or Neuromorphic platforms  
**Graduates:** open-source AI accelerators (Ztachip, VTA, Gemmini, VeriGOOD-ML, NVDLA) or any of the above 

## 3. Problem Definition
The problem which we are addressing is that traditional input methods (like mouse and keyboard) can be limiting for real-time hands-free applications. Our project will address this by recognizing hand gestures and translating them into computer commands using edge-AI. This project will demonstrate how AI hardware can enable low-latency, scalable, and interactive embedded AI solutions.

## 4. Technical Objectives
List 3–5 measurable objectives with quantitative targets when possible.
1. We should be able to identify the thumbs up, open palm, fist, and pointing gestures. 
2. We should be able to identify the gestures more than 90% of the time.
3. The Raspberry Pi should print each gesture after detecting it within 150 ms. 
4. Model should be optimized to run entirely on-device.

## 5. Methodology
Describe your planned approach: hardware setup, software tools, model design, performance metrics, and validation strategy.

## 6. Expected Deliverables
List tangible outputs: working demo, GitHub repository, documentation, presentation slides, and final report.

## 7. Team Responsibilities
List each member’s main role.

| Name | Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| [Student A] | Team Lead | Coordination, documentation |
| [Student B] | Hardware | Setup, integration |
| [Student C] | Software | Model training, inference |
| [Student D] | Evaluation | Testing, benchmarking |

## 8. Timeline and Milestones
Provide expected milestones:

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 2 | Proposal | PDF + GitHub submission |
| 4 | Midterm presentation | Slides, preliminary results |
| 6 | Integration & testing | Working prototype |
| Dec. 18 | Final presentation | Report, demo, GitHub archive |

## 9. Resources Required
List special hardware, datasets, or compute access needed.

## 10. References
Include relevant papers, repositories, and documentation.
